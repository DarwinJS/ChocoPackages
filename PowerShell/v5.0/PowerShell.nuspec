        IMPORTANT NOTES for your Operating System:
		
		    PowerShell 4 and later requires at least .NET 3.5.1.  
			This package will warn you and exit if it is not installed.
			It is not automatically installed as a dependency so that you 
			maintain complete control over the .NET version in your build.
