Hi Darwin,

Sure, I grant you permission to distribute it however it fits you best.

Thank you for informing me; too bad that the names clash now.
I will see if I find another solution because this will clash with people/companies that distribute/call it from their applications/frameworks.
I will have a look at the new CLI to see how it is now.

Thank you & best regards,
Nick
