    <description>Open SSH tools for Windows.
      This is the Microsoft PowerShell Team's recent port.
      Works in all CLIs and does not require .NET.

      CloudyWindows.com Utility Scripts:
      * Set-SSHKeyPermissions.ps1

      This package performs the following operations that you normally have to hack at until you get what you want:
      * Install Appropriate Bitness for the version of Windows
      * Install to Program Files (malware protection and following advice of dev team)
      * Add SSH location to System PATH
      * Optionally install sshd windows service (Requires parameter - see below)
      * Cleanly uninstall all of the above (removing config files and server keys requires special switch - see below)

      The package also attempts to keep you out of trouble when configuring the sshd service:
        * Will not install sshd server if an different sshd server is already running
        * Will not delete server keys on uninstall or reinstall (unless you override with switch below)
        * Will not upgrade or uninstall if the service is running and you did not specify /SSHServerFeature (you forget about the service on a machine where you want to upgrade the client tools)
        * If you use the server's Key Based Authentication feature, install and uninstall behave differently to account for the integration of this component

      This package supports the following parameters:

      -params '"/SSHServerFeature"' (Install and Uninstall)
      Also install sshd Windows Service - including opening port 22.
      If this parameter is not included on an upgrade or uninstall and
      the sshd server is installed - an error is generated.  You must
      use this switch to indicate you have made preparations for the
      sshd service to be interrupted or removed.

      -params '"/SSHAgentFeature"'
      Installs SSH Agent Service even if SSHD Server is not being installed.
      Requires admin rights to configure service.
      This option is automatically set when /SSHServerFeature is used.

      -params '"/SSHAgentFeature /ReleaseSSHLSAForUpgrade"'
      If ssh-lsa.dll is locked, this switch de-configures ssh-lsa.dll from loading on bootup.
      You then must reboot and re-run the package -force to install the new version of ssh-lsa.dll.
      A second reboot will be required in order to make the new version active.
      See: https://github.com/DarwinJS/ChocoPackages/blob/master/openssh/readme.md

      -params '"/SSHServerFeature /SSHServerPort:3834"'
      Allows the setup of the SSH server on an alternate port - sometimes done for security or to avoid conflicts with an existing service on port 22.

      -params '"/OverWriteSSHDConf"'
      Introduced in Version: 0.0.9.20170311
      By default an existing sshd_conf file will not be overwritten (previous packaging versions always overwrote)
      Use this switch to overwrite an existing sshd_conf with the one from the current install media

      -params '"/SSHLogLevel:VERBOSE"'
      Introduced in Version: 0.0.9.20170311
      Allows the setup of the SSH logging level.
      Valid Options: QUIET, FATAL, ERROR, INFO, VERBOSE, DEBUG, DEBUG1, DEBUG2, DEBUG3
      On a fresh install LogLevel is set to QUIET

      -params '"/SSHServerFeature /DeleteServerKeysAfterInstalled"'
      Also install sshd Windows Service - including opening port 22 and
      it with Key Based Authentication (reboot required before active)
      Server keys are deleted after added to the ssh-agent (you will not have an opportunity to copy them)

      -params '"/SSHServerFeature /DeleteConfigAndServerKeys"' (Uninstall)
      By default an uninstall does not remove config files nor server keys.

      -params '"/UseNTRights"'
      By default the install uses PowerShell code that works on operating systems that cannot run the 32-bit ntrights.exe (Nano, Server Core w/out WOW64).
      If this code does not work for you, you can use this switch to invoke the 32-bit ntrights.exe

        - updated barebonesinstaller.ps1 to take all switches chocolatey takes

        - displays before and after versions of all EXES in SSH install folder and ssh-lsa.dll
        - readme updates for barebonesinstaller.ps1 (due to version 0.0.10.0 not sorting properly with previous versions)
        - Dockerfile updates (due to version 0.0.10.0 not sorting properly with previous versions)

      0.0.9.20170311
         - no longer overwrites sshd_conf if it already exists, unless /OverWriteSSHDConf is used
         - supports setting SSHD LogLevel during install or upgrade using /SSHLogLevel
         - automatically creates "logs" subfolder in install folder so that if logging is enabled 
           in the config file it starts without requiring a manual folder creation
      0.0.9.20170308 - fix to fileinuseutiles.ps1 to not resolve path when target does not exist
