      *****************************************************************************
      This package is actually a universal installer that can install in any scenario - including without Chocolatey.
      Read here for more information: https://github.com/DarwinJS/ChocoPackages/blob/master/openssh/readme.md
      *****************************************************************************
      
      CloudyWindows.com Utility Scripts:
      * Set-SSHKeyPermissions.ps1

      This package supports the following parameters:

      -params '"/SSHServerFeature"' (Install and Uninstall)
      Also install sshd Windows Service - including opening port 22.
      If this parameter is not included on an upgrade or uninstall and
      the sshd server is installed - an error is generated.  You must
      use this switch to indicate you have made preparations for the
      sshd service to be interrupted or removed.

      -params '"/SSHAgentFeature"'
      Installs SSH Agent Service even if SSHD Server is not being installed.
      Requires admin rights to configure service.
      This option is automatically set when /SSHServerFeature is used.

      -params '"/SSHServerFeature /SSHServerPort:3834"'
      Allows the setup of the SSH server on an alternate port - sometimes done for security or to avoid conflicts with an existing service on port 22.

      -params '"/OverWriteSSHDConf"'
      Introduced in Version: 0.0.9.20170311
      By default an existing sshd_conf file will not be overwritten (previous packaging versions always overwrote)
      Use this switch to overwrite an existing sshd_conf with the one from the current install media

      -params '"/SSHLogLevel:VERBOSE"'
      Introduced in Version: 0.0.9.20170311
      Allows the setup of the SSH logging level.
      Valid Options: QUIET, FATAL, ERROR, INFO, VERBOSE, DEBUG, DEBUG1, DEBUG2, DEBUG3
      On a fresh install LogLevel is set to QUIET

      -params '"/TERM:xterm-new"'
      Introduced in Version: 0.0.14.0
      Allows the initial setup and subsequent update of the TERM system environment variable.
      On a fresh install TERM is set to xterm whether or not this switch is used.

      -params '"/DisableKeyPermissionsReset"'
      Introduced in Version: 0.0.15.0
      As of 0.0.13.0 new key permissions are required for ssh keys.  By default this installer
      reasserts these permissions whenever run.  Used this switch if you do not want the installation
      to attempt to manage key permissions.  The utility script will still be installed and available
      if you need to use it later to fix up permissions.

      -params '"/SSHServerFeature /DeleteServerKeysAfterInstalled"'
      Also install sshd Windows Service - including opening port 22 and
      it with Key Based Authentication (reboot required before active)
      Server keys are deleted after added to the ssh-agent (you will not have an opportunity to copy them)

      -params '"/SSHServerFeature /DeleteConfigAndServerKeys"' (Uninstall)
      By default an uninstall does not remove config files nor server keys.

      -params '"/UseNTRights"'
      By default the install uses PowerShell code that works on operating systems that cannot run the 32-bit ntrights.exe (Nano, Server Core w/out WOW64).
      If this code does not work for you, you can use this switch to invoke the 32-bit ntrights.exe

      Product release notes: https://github.com/PowerShell/Win32-OpenSSH/releases/tag/v0.0.16.0

      Release Notes for Chocolatey Packaging:
      0.0.16.0
        - Fixed incomplete permissions grant when using /NTRights switch.
        - Fixed uninstall implementation
        - Fixed uninstall and clean uninstall for Nano
        - Uses version of opensshutils shipped with openssh
      0.0.15.20170613
        - Fixed problem for issue #35 (error with "$RunningOnNano not found").
        - /DeleteConfigAndServerKeys now works.
      0.0.15.20170611
        - Sets permissions for user "NT SERVICE\sshd" to write to [sshfolder]\Logs
      0.0.15.0
        - Calls utility script FixUserFilePermissions.ps1 (included with OpenSSH) to align setup / migrate 
          permissions to v.0.0.15.0 standard. Permissions are reasserted at every install / upgrade.
        - A chocolatey uninstall that specifies "/DeleteConfigAndServerKeys" will fail.  This is only ever used
          for a completely clean uninstall - not using it means that the ssh_conf and the server key files will
          remain in the openssh install folder and will need to be removed manually after taking ownership of the files.
        - New switch /DisableKeyPermissionsReset disables this capability if you are managing permissions separately.
      0.0.14.0
        - by default sets a machine environment variable TERM=xterm, customize with /TERM switch
        - updated path setting code to not make unnecessary path alterations
      0.0.12.0
        - ssh-lsa.dll is no longer needed and no longer configured (switch /ReleaseSSHLSAForUpgrade is ignored)
        - if ssh-lsa.dll is found during upgrade a delete attempt is made - if unsuccessful (file locked), ssh-lsa.dll 
          will be deconfigured as an authentication package and it will be delete on the next upgrade.
      0.0.11.0
        - /ReleaseSSHLSAForUpgrade - switch that de-configures ssh-lsa.dll in preparation for updating it after a reboot and forced reinstall (and another reboot).  See: https://github.com/DarwinJS/ChocoPackages/blob/master/openssh/readme.md
        - Set-SSHKeyPermissions.ps1 - new utility for setting permissions on all existing user's authorized_keys files is placed in SSHD binaries folder (on path)
        - Calls Set-SSHKeyPermissions.ps1 during install to ensure existing keys are compliant with security updates in SSH 0.0.11.0
        - Fix - uninstall was not deconfiguring ssh-lsa.dll from load at startup.
        - updated barebonesinstaller.ps1 to take all switches chocolatey takes
      0.0.10.20170402
        - fix to looking versions of installed exes for PSH 2
      0.0.10.20170331
        - fix to looking versions of installed exes for Nano
      0.0.10.20170329
        - fixed issue looking up the path of conflicting sshd service (if one exists)
        - fixed problem for nano with listing of exe versions introdcued in 0.0.10.0
      0.0.10.0 
        - displays before and after versions of all EXES in SSH install folder and ssh-lsa.dll
        - readme updates for barebonesinstaller.ps1 (due to version 0.0.10.0 not sorting properly with previous versions)
        - Dockerfile updates (due to version 0.0.10.0 not sorting properly with previous versions)
        - Fix for Nano for barebonesinstaller.ps1 calling 7z.exe
      0.0.9.20170313 - fix for Win7/Server 2008 + PSH 2 When Installing SSHServerFeature
      0.0.9.20170311
         - no longer overwrites sshd_conf if it already exists, unless /OverWriteSSHDConf is used
         - supports setting SSHD LogLevel during install or upgrade using /SSHLogLevel
         - automatically creates "logs" subfolder in install folder so that if logging is enabled 
           in the config file it starts without requiring a manual folder creation
      0.0.9.20170308 - fix to fileinuseutiles.ps1 to not resolve path when target does not exist
      0.0.9.20170306 - fix to ensure sshlsa.dll always gets installed when it should (thanks @felfert !)
      0.0.9.20170226 - fix to allow barebones.ps1 to work on PSH 2 (e.g. Server 2008 R2)
      0.0.9.20170222 - removal of stray file
      0.0.9.0 - fix for problem detecting our install of sshd
