    <summary>Open SSH tools for Windows - work in all CLIs.</summary>
    <description>Open SSH tools for Windows.
      This is the Microsoft PowerShell Team's recent port.
      Works in all CLIs and does not require .NET.
      Includes the following tools:
      * ssh.exe
      * ssh-add.exe
      * ssh-agent.exe
      * ssh-keygen.exe
      * ssh-keyscan.exe
      * ssh-keysign.exe
      * ssh-pkcs11-helper.exe
      * scp.exe
      * sftp.exe
      * sshd.exe (server)
      * sftp-server.exe

      This package performs the following operations that you normally have to hack at until you get what you want:
      * Install Appropriate Bitness for the version of Windows
      * Install to Program Files (malware protection and following advice of dev team)
      * Add SSH location to System PATH
      * Optionally install sshd windows service (Requires parameter - see below)
      * Optionally install sshd server "key based authentication" (Requires parameter - see below)
      * Cleanly uninstall all of the above (removing config files and server keys requires special switch - see below)

      The package also attempts to keep you out of trouble when configuring the sshd service:
        * Will not install sshd server if an different sshd server is already running
        * Will not delete server keys on uninstall or reinstall (unless you override with switch below)
        * Will not upgrade or uninstall if the service is running and you did not specify /SSHServerFeature (you forget about the service on a machine where you want to upgrade the client tools)
        * If you use the server's Key Based Authentication feature, install and uninstall behave differently to account for the integration of this component

      This package supports the following parameters:

      -params '"/SSHServerFeature"' (Install and Uninstall)
      Also install sshd Windows Service - including opening port 22.
      If this parameter is not included on an upgrade or uninstall and
      the sshd server is installed - an error is generated.  You must
      use this switch to indicate you have made preparations for the
      sshd service to be interrupted or removed.

      -params '"/SSHAgentFeature"'
      Installs SSH Agent Service even if SSHD Server is not being installed.
      Requires admin rights to configure service.
      This option is automatically set when /SSHServerFeature is used.

      -params '"/SSHServerFeature /SSHServerPort:3834"'
      Allows the setup of the SSH server on an alternate port - sometimes done for security or to avoid conflicts with an existing service on port 22.

      RETIRED: -params '"/KeyBasedAuthenticationFeature"'
      NO LONGER NECESSARY - KeyBasedAuthentiation is always configured
      if the /SSHServerFeature switch is used.

      -params '"/SSHServerFeature /DeleteServerKeysAfterInstalled"'
      Also install sshd Windows Service - including opening port 22 and
      it with Key Based Authentication (reboot required before active)
      Server keys are deleted after added to the ssh-agent (you will not have an opportunity to copy them)

      -params '"/SSHServerFeature /DeleteConfigAndServerKeys"' (Uninstall)
      By default an uninstall does not remove config files nor server keys.

      -params '"/UseNTRights"'
      By default the install uses PowerShell code that works on operating systems that cannot run the 32-bit ntrights.exe (Nano, Server Core w/out WOW64).
      If this code does not work for you, you can use this switch to invoke the 32-bit ntrights.exe
      Please be aware that 32-bit ntrights.exe will NOT work on Windows Systems that doe not have WOW64 installed - this would mainly
      affect Server Core where this feature is optional and not installed by default and Server Nano where 32-bit is not supported.

    <releaseNotes>

      0.0.2.20161026
      - FIX: "Get-FileHash" is only used if it is available

      0.0.2.0
      - NEW: /SSHAgentFeature - enables SSH agent for use with client tools when /SSHServerFeature is not used.
      - NEW: Sample Dockerfile included for Server Core 2016 or Nano.
      - FIX: Uninstall improved.
      - NEW: InstallChoco_and_win32-openssh.ps1 and InstallChoco_and_win32-openssh_with_server.ps1 both refresh
             the environment after installing OpenSSH so it can be used in the same console it was installed in.
      - FIX: ssh-add is only run after ssh-agent is started.
      - FIX: sshd and ssh-agent are always started (if installed), however, a warning to reboot is still generated
             if key based authentication is being used.

      0.0.0.9
      - NEW: Chocolatey package id is now "openssh"
      - NEW: Set listenting port with parameter /SSHServerPort
      - NEW: Enhanced detection of possible port conflicts with requested listening port
             Specifically calls out Developer Mode SSH (Windows 10 Developer Mode)
      - NEW: more complete readme: https://github.com/DarwinJS/ChocoPackages/blob/master/openssh/readme.md
      - NEW: install on Nano and ServerCore w/out WOW64 (Chocolatey not needed) like this (PSH 5 required):
          1) Open a command line on the target (remoting for Nano) and run:
          2) Install-Packagerovider NuGet -forcebootstrap -force
          3) Register-PackageSource -name chocolatey -provider nuget -location http://chocolatey.org/api/v2/ -trusted
          4) Install-Package openssh -provider NuGet
          5) cd "$((dir "$env:ProgramFiles\nuget\packages\OpenSSH*\tools" |select -last 1).fullname)"
          6) .".\barebonesinstaller.ps1" -SSHServerFeature
      - FIX: to prevent repeatedly adding "ssh-lsa" when already present (on forced installs, etc.)
      - FIX: to uninstall to prevent leaving lsa-ssh authentication provider entries on system
      - NEW: ource files are now internal (makes for easier curation and easier for above barebonesinstaller.ps1)
      - FIX: crashing uninstall script
      - FIX: properly add SSH folder to path on Nano

      2016.05.30.20160827 (package ID: Win32-OpenSSH)
      - Switch "/KeyBasedAuthenticationFeature" is retired - key based authentication always configured when using "/SSHServerFeature"
      - With switch /UseNTRights Package uses ntrights.exe on 32-bit windows and on 64-bit windows - ONLY IF THE 32-bit SUBSYSTEM IS INSTALLED - otherwise it attempts to use Posh Code to grant SeAssignPrimaryTokenPrivilege.
        Code used for setting rights WITHOUT /UseNTRights was tested as working on Nano, which means it should work on server core without WOW64.

    Package explicity sets log level to QUIET because on some systems the current version of sshd repeatedly logs the same line at a rate of about 1 GB / 2 hours with default log settings.
    Package incorporates securing of the server keys using the SSH agent as per the product release notes below.
