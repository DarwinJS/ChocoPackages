      Release Notes for Chocolatey Packaging:
      1.0.0.20180131
        - no longer automatically adds ssh-agent when installing sshd.  You must specify /SSHAgentFeature if you want it installed.
      1.0.0.0
        - complies with new changes to installation for 1.0.0.0 and attempts migration of pre-1.0.0.0 items.
        - removed switch $DisableKeyPermissionsReset
        - removed switch $UseNTRights and ntrights.exe from package
        - uses new 1.0.0.0 model for service users and permissions
        - no longer explicitly sets TERM for new installs (unless you specify the parameter) - instead relies on default behavior of sshd.exe
      0.0.24.0
        - Fixed bug in uninstall (https://github.com/DarwinJS/ChocoPackages/issues/52)
        - Uses new code from OpenSSH project for adding special privileges (is more compatible with newer Nano releases)
      0.0.23.0
        - None
      0.0.22.0
        - Fix error when uninstall runs and openssh folder is already removed: https://github.com/DarwinJS/ChocoPackages/issues/49
        - Fix error using PSH 5 Package Management to install on Server 2016: https://github.com/DarwinJS/ChocoPackages/issues/47
        - Added switches for Default Shell configuration - for both chocolatey and barebonesinstall.ps1 
          (PathSpecsToProbeForShellEXEString, SSHDefaultShellCommandOption and AllowInsecureShellEXE)
          Make the latest powershell core or windows powershell the default shell:
          /PathSpecsToProbeForShellEXEString:$env:programfiles\PowerShell\*\pwsh.exe;$env:programfiles\PowerShell\*\Powershell.exe;c:\windows\system32\windowspowershell\v1.0\powershell.exe"
          -PathSpecsToProbeForShellEXEString "$env:programfiles\PowerShell\*\pwsh.exe;$env:programfiles\PowerShell\*\Powershell.exe;c:\windows\system32\windowspowershell\v1.0\powershell.exe"
          Rules and More Examples: https://github.com/DarwinJS/ChocoPackages/blob/master/openssh/tools/Set-SSHDefaultShell.ps1

      This package supports the following parameters:

          -params '"/SSHServerFeature"' (Install and Uninstall)
          Also install sshd Windows Service - including opening port 22.
          If this parameter is not included on an upgrade or uninstall and
          the sshd server is installed - an error is generated.  You must
          use this switch to indicate you have made preparations for the
          sshd service to be interrupted or removed.

          -params '"/SSHAgentFeature"'
          Installs SSH Agent Service even if SSHD Server is not being installed.
          Requires admin rights to configure service.

          -params '"/SSHServerFeature /SSHServerPort:3834"'
          Allows the setup of the SSH server on an alternate port - sometimes done for security or to avoid conflicts with an existing service on port 22.

          -params '"/OverWriteSSHDConf"'
          Introduced in Version: 0.0.9.20170311
          By default an existing sshd_conf file will not be overwritten (previous packaging versions always overwrote)
          Use this switch to overwrite an existing sshd_conf with the one from the current install media

          -params '"/SSHLogLevel:VERBOSE"'
          Introduced in Version: 0.0.9.20170311
          Allows the setup of the SSH logging level.
          Valid Options: QUIET, FATAL, ERROR, INFO, VERBOSE, DEBUG, DEBUG1, DEBUG2, DEBUG3
          On a fresh install LogLevel is set to QUIET

          -params '"/TERM:xterm-new"'
          Introduced in Version: 0.0.14.0
          Allows the initial setup and subsequent update of the TERM system environment variable.
          On a fresh install TERM is set to xterm whether or not this switch is used.

          -params '"/SSHServerFeature /DeleteServerKeysAfterInstalled"'
          Also install sshd Windows Service - including opening port 22 and
          it with Key Based Authentication (reboot required before active)
          Server keys are deleted after added to the ssh-agent (you will not have an opportunity to copy them)

          -params '"/SSHServerFeature /DeleteConfigAndServerKeys"' (Uninstall)
          By default an uninstall does not remove config files nor server keys.

          -params '"/PathSpecsToProbeForShellEXEString:$env:programfiles\PowerShell\*\Powershell.exe;$env:windir\system32\windowspowershell\v1.0\powershell.exe"'
          Introduced in Version: 0.0.22.0
          A set of filespecs to probe for the latest version of a given shell exe.  Wildcards can be used in the path, but not the filename.
          The first filespec to result in a one or more valid hits will be choosen for the default SSH shell (newest version when there are multiple hits).
          If not valid hits are located with the entire set of filespecs, the default behavior of not setting the registry key is taken (rather than an error).
          Only exe's in either Program Files folder or either System32 folder (system32, syswow64) will considered safe.  If the EXE is outside of these folders
          you must use the /AllowInsecureShellEXE switch to have it configured.
          Rules and Examples: https://github.com/DarwinJS/ChocoPackages/blob/master/openssh/tools/Set-SSHDefaultShell.ps1
          
          -params '"/SSHDefaultShellCommandOption:/c"'
          Introduced in Version: 0.0.22.0
          Only used when /PathSpecsToProbeForShellEXEString is used and results in finding a valid shell executable.
          Rules and Examples: https://github.com/DarwinJS/ChocoPackages/blob/master/openssh/tools/Set-SSHDefaultShell.ps1

          -params '"/AllowInsecureShellEXE"'
          Introduced in Version: 0.0.22.0
          Only used when /PathSpecsToProbeForShellEXEString is used and results in finding a valid shell executable that is outside of the Programs Folders or system32.
          Rules and Examples: https://github.com/DarwinJS/ChocoPackages/blob/master/openssh/tools/Set-SSHDefaultShell.ps1


      0.0.21.0
        - none
      0.0.20.20170913
        - added possible missing command from install-sshd.ps1 (sc.exe privs sshd SeAssignPrimaryTokenPrivilege)
      0.0.20.0
        - handle edge case error for Azure Custom Script Extensions and DSC cChocoInstalledPackage resource 
          where GetTempFileName does not find TEMP folder when running under SYSTEM account.
      0.0.19.0
        - sshlsa features are removed from install package as this dll is no longer required for Openssh
      0.0.18.20170730
        - TERM defaults to 'xterm-256color' on windows kernel 10.x and above
      0.0.18.0
        - updated instructions for non-chocolatey install so that they do not add the source location as "trusted"
      0.0.17.0
        - fixes latest opensshutils.psm1 to work on Nano
      0.0.16.0
        - Fixed incomplete permissions grant when using /NTRights switch.
        - Fixed uninstall implementation
        - Fixed uninstall and clean uninstall for Nano
        - Uses version of opensshutils shipped with openssh
      0.0.15.20170613
        - Fixed problem for issue #35 (error with "$RunningOnNano not found").
        - /DeleteConfigAndServerKeys now works.
      0.0.15.20170611
        - Sets permissions for user "NT SERVICE\sshd" to write to [sshfolder]\Logs
      0.0.15.0
        - Calls utility script FixUserFilePermissions.ps1 (included with OpenSSH) to align setup / migrate 
          permissions to v.0.0.15.0 standard. Permissions are reasserted at every install / upgrade.
        - A chocolatey uninstall that specifies "/DeleteConfigAndServerKeys" will fail.  This is only ever used
          for a completely clean uninstall - not using it means that the ssh_conf and the server key files will
          remain in the openssh install folder and will need to be removed manually after taking ownership of the files.
        - New switch /DisableKeyPermissionsReset disables this capability if you are managing permissions separately.
      0.0.14.0
        - by default sets a machine environment variable TERM=xterm, customize with /TERM switch
        - updated path setting code to not make unnecessary path alterations
      0.0.12.0
        - ssh-lsa.dll is no longer needed and no longer configured (switch /ReleaseSSHLSAForUpgrade is ignored)
        - if ssh-lsa.dll is found during upgrade a delete attempt is made - if unsuccessful (file locked), ssh-lsa.dll 
          will be deconfigured as an authentication package and it will be delete on the next upgrade.
